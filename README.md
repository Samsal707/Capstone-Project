 WebApp for a small business:
    - In this particular setting the application was an initial offering to a client who wanted an application that can help her manage their samll pet (of the feline kind) grooming business and provide a convenient way for users to register and book for the services provided. 

# The business Context of the Application
## What the Application offers for small scale businesses:    
It focuses on helping a small business like this:
    - register new clientelle
    - offers convenience for customers/clients
    - maintain records of their clientelle
    - offer advertising space to other businesses
    - improved business decision making
        - record of activities 
        - recording of activities on the site generate data that can be used to determine who may further potential clients and how they may be better served by a business
        
    

## Further Potentials for a small business having a website:
    Small businesses need to increase their visibility on the web - and having such an application helps to meet that goal. Furthermore with a presence online a business there is potential for growth. A website can provide advertising space for other businesses or clients and potentially lead to the growth and integration into other businesses. Furthermore a website which embraces data persistence and backend operations offers can easily integrate into other API and further improve its business activities. We can imagine integrating into banking services, taxation and other financial services.

## Features of the websidte
 1. Provision for Registration of clients: A form componet can create an account by filling out contact and pet information, as well as their preferred services and availability.

2. Provision of authorised Login of users into their accounts using email address and password.

3. Once logged they can select services and book an appointment for cat. They can also send a message by email to the business.

4. When booking -  dates and times can be selected.

5. The website will facilitate a secure payment system - perhaps through Stripe or PayPal.

6. Staff in the business will also be able to login. And on logging have access to the bookings list including service list, payment reports

4. All of the above will have its own page. The landing/"front page" will be such that a user has an option to register or login. In additon the landing page will give a synopsis of services offered and pictures of cats/kittens and contact detail of the pusiness.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
